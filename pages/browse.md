{% capture searchtext %}The search box on this page is very simple. It only searches for strings of text (i.e. words in a row) in the following fields for each item in the collection: 

{% for f in site.data.config-browse %}
-{{f.field}}
{% endfor %}. 

You cannot use boolean searching (i.e. `ands` and/or `ors`) or quotation marks to refine your searches -- basically, all searches are searches for phrases that typically would be put in quotation marks in google, etc.

For more advanced searching capability, use the search box in the navbar above, or go to {{'/search.html/' | relative_url }}.
