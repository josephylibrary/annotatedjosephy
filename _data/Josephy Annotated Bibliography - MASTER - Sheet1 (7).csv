Editors at Viking Press asked him to profile other important Indian Chiefs. He picked “patriots,” who fought for their tribes’ continued presence and cultures: Hiawatha, King Philip, Popé, Pontiac, Tecumseh, Osceola, Black Hawk, Crazy Horse, as well as Joseph. The book was published in 1961, and then became popular with the social movements of the late 60s and early 70s. It has remained in print since 1961.
