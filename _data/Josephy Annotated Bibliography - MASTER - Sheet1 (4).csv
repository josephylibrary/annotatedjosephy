The Indian Heritage of America,"This book, published in 1968, was a finalist for the National Book Award. In discussing Indians of North, Central, and South Americas, and their relationships with colonizers from Columbus to modern times, Josephy relied on latest in linguistic and archeological research available at the time. He trusted tribal knowledge too, and spoke for Indians’ longer tenure and larger historical populations in the New World than most of his contemporaries.

It was reissued without notes in paperback by Yale and U Nebraska, and the complete text with notes reissued in 1997 by Houghton Mifflin. It is still considered the definitive text on the Nez Perce, with prodigious research on the impacts on them and other Columbia Basin tribes by the fur trade, missionaries, settlers, treaty makers and the military.
