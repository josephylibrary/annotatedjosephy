The Civil War in the American West,book,AMJ first wrote a shorter treatment of the Civil War in the West;<em>The Civil War: War on the Frontier</em>; as part of a huge Time-Life series on the Civil War; in 1986. In this book; he covers major campaigns and actions directly related to the War; and those massacres of Indians at the hands of regular and recruited local troops; and the outbreaks that impacted the tribes specifically; e.g. the Minnesota Uprising and the Union troops diverted to put it down. Overall; Josephy claims that “During the four years of the Civil War;… more Indian tribes were destroyed by whites and more land was seized from them than in almost any other comparable time in American history.”,American history general; American Indian general; Sioux; Indian-white relations; Indian public policy; Civil War; Atrocities against Indians; Indian uprisings,,,,91807.jpg,91807,Alvin M.

The Nez Perce Indians and the Opening of the Northwest,book,Although he stopped work on this book to write <em>Patriot Chiefs </em> (19610; this Nez Perce history really established Josephy’s reputation as a serious historian of American Indians and the West. The book was to have been published by Knopf (Alfred A. was Alvin’s uncle) but it was too long; and Alvin did not want to cut it. Alfred recommended Yale U Press; which did publish it. It was reissued without notes in paperback by Yale and U Nebraska; and the complete text with notes reissued in 1997 by Houghton Mifflin. It is still considered the definitive text on the Nez Perce; with prodigious research on the impacts on them and other Columbia Basin tribes by the fur trade; missionaries; settlers; treaty makers and the military.
