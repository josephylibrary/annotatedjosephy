The Civil War in the American West,book,"||AMJ first wrote a shorter treatment of the Civil War in the West,<em>The Civil War: War on the Frontier</em>, as part of a huge Time-Life series on the Civil War, in 1986. In this book, he covers major campaigns and actions directly related to the War, and those massacres of Indians at the hands of regular and recruited local troops, and the outbreaks that impacted the tribes specifically, e.g. the Minnesota Uprising and the Union troops diverted to put it down. Overall, Josephy claims that “During the four years of the Civil War,… more Indian tribes were destroyed by whites and more land was seized from them than in almost any other comparable time in American history.”",American history general; American Indian general; Sioux; Indian-white relations; Indian public policy; Civil War; Atrocities against Indians; Indian uprisings,,,,91807.jpg,91807,Alvin M.
